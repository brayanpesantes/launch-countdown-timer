## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)  - for animations
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively use Tailwind CSS for styling and how to implement a countdown timer in React. I also gained experience in creating responsive designs and handling hover states for interactive elements.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my skills in responsive design and explore more advanced features of Tailwind CSS. I also plan to delve deeper into Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This was extremely helpful for understanding how to use utility-first CSS.
- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - Great resource for understanding the fundamentals of React.
